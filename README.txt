Charles Meyer's Github IO Page

WHAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED
Everything, to the best of my knowledge, has been implemented correctly,
including all 3 HTML5 pages (index.html, resume.html, bio.html) hosted on 
Github and the index.html on my Tufts account which redirects to 
charles-meyer.github.io.

COLLABORATION
I did not actively collaborate with anyone in Comp20, however I did consult
Stack Overflow regarding how to make index.html on my Tufts CS account 
redirect to my Github page.

TIME SPENT
I spent ~4 hours completing the assignment.
