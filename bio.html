    <h1>Charles Meyer's <br/>Biography</h1>
    <div id="content">
    <p>I'm Charlie Meyer, I hail from Pembroke, MA, and am a student at Tufts University (A&amp;S 2017).</p>
    <p>I like math, coding, the New England Patriots, learning new stuff, and teaching other people new stuff. Music is another interest of mine; I play clarinet in the Tufts Wind Ensemble and sing in the Tufts Gospel Choir. Most people like to ask me about my watch: it's a Pebble, which is a platform I love using and devloping for. Elon Musk is my idol, and I religiously watch SpaceX launches and cannot wait for the day I can buy a Tesla. I'm a DJ at WMFO, rocking the 7am-8am Friday morning timeslot like it's my job. </p>
